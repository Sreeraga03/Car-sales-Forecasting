# Car-Sales-Forecasting
This repository contains a comprehensive project for forecasting car sales using time series analysis. The project leverages machine learning models, particularly ARIMA,SARIMAX and LSTM, to predict future car sales based on historical data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a web-based dashboard for visualizing the forecasts.
